# Kulsum and Nadeem's Relationship: Quantitative Analysis

## Overview

This project performs a structured longitudinal analysis of the high-stability, long-distance relationship between Nadeem and Kulsum.

Time Span:
September 17, 2024 – Present

Evaluated Duration:
1 year, 1 month, 1 day


## Objectives

- Track milestone density
- Evaluate emotional trend stability
- Assess growth consistency
- Model long-term scalability


## Dataset Structure

Columns included:

- date → Timestamp of event
- event_category → Classification of milestone type
- event_label → Descriptive identifier
- significance_score → Emotional weight (1–10 scale)
- conflict_flag → Binary stability indicator
- growth_index → Relational growth impact
- distance_phase → Stage classification
- encoded_value → Numerical metadata


## Key Findings

- Strong upward emotional trajectory
- High milestone concentration
- Positive growth correlation
- No observed degradation due to distance
- Long-term projection indicates exponential stability


## Visualization

Emotional Significance Trend plotted using matplotlib.
Color choice: #FC6A80  
Reason: Because even structured systems deserve aesthetic coherence.


## Projection Model

A simple exponential growth model was applied:

base = 100  
growth_rate = 0.15  

Result:
System demonstrates scalable long-term viability.


## Conclusion

Classification:
Stable | Resilient | High Growth | Long-Term Optimized

## Notes

- Dataset contains no redundant features.
- All numerical fields serve a purpose.
- ** Further exploratory analysis may reveal additional insights.**
